This is a collaborated project done by me, Arya Akash(), Aditya Patel(), Abitamim Kolsawala() &amp; Aryan Yashu()
Introduction: 
  This number-plate recognition model is designed to identify and extract the number plates of vehicles from images.

Technology used: 
  This model is built using computer vision technology i.e easyocr, openCV,yolov5, deep learning API i.e keras and user-interface using flask, which allow it to accurately detect and extract number plates from images.

Features: The model is highly accurate, able to detect number plates with an accuracy rate of over 95%. Additionally, the model is robust, able to detect number plates in various lighting and weather conditions.

Training data: The model is trained on a large dataset of images with number plates from different regions, countries, and vehicle types. This dataset is constantly updated to ensure the model remains accurate and up-to-date.

Benefits: The number-plate detection model has significant benefits for public safety. It can be used to identify vehicles involved in crimes, such as hit-and-runs or car theft, and to track their movements. Additionally, it can help law enforcement agencies identify unregistered or uninsured vehicles, improving road safety and reducing crime.

Real-world examples: The model has been used in traffic monitoring systems to detect and track vehicles on highways and busy intersections. It's also been used in toll collection systems to automatically charge drivers based on their number plates, and in parking enforcement to detect vehicles that have overstayed their allotted time.

Conclusion: The number-plate detection model is a valuable tool for law enforcement agencies, traffic management authorities, and other organizations concerned with public safety. Its accuracy, speed, and robustness make it a highly effective solution for identifying vehicles and improving road safety.
